# Agent Framework

Modular Python framework for both heuristic and reinforcement learning agents.

## Structure
- `agents/`: Different agent implementations.
- `actions/`: Action logic and execution.
- `goals/`: Goal management.
- `environment/`: Interaction layer.
- `memory/`: Agent memory stores.
- `policies/`: Strategy engines.
- `utils/`: Logging and utilities.

Run `main.py` to see a basic agent in action.
